Notes
	1. RTOS chip for the implementation
	2. Unlevel plane angle measurement
	3. Brake pedal not pushed - no light is ok
	4. Polling time for obd2
	5. Not universal codes ?
	6. What are the information - g force
	7. OEM lamp vs external work for both
	8.	Use transistor and esp32 flashing no need for flasher
	9. One flash sequence
	10. Possibly using EEPROM just to save value
	
WANTS
Circuitry to be able not to splice the brake light wire
Not having to put a dry contact to 
If the load is being energized, actually put circuitry 

12 V wire -> load -> ground
before load there is a wire attached to it to some sort of circuit board
circuit board when it is told to, would be
